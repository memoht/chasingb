      Robina was born in Melbourne and brought up as a Catholic. She studied classical singing until her early twenties. In 1967 she traveled to London where she lived for four years and became actively involved in the radical left, working mainly with a London-based support group for black and Chicano prisoners. In the early seventies she became a feminist and returned to Melbourne to work with other radical feminists. In her quest for a spiritual path Robina began studying martial arts in 1974, and moved to New York where she studied karate. She continued karate in Melbourne until 1976, when she attended a Tibetan Buddhist course in Queensland given by Lama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche. She traveled to Kathmandu the following year and ordained as a Buddhist nun at Kopan Monastery.
